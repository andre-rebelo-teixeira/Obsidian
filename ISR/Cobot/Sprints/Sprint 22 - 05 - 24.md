# Work Shown

The work shown was the following
- [x] Delay generator for multiple topics with with configurable json file for both delay and topics
- [x] Camera Calibration file already complete
- [x] Camera driver working
> The ROS2 camera driver working was still only configurable with changing the code, and not with parameters from either the launch configuration parameters or with a json file 

# Work decided for the next week
- [ ] Find an Aruco detector package to be able to detect the robot position in the frame
- [ ] Correct the image distortion using the calibration file we got for it to be easier to understand the image
- [ ] Draw the avatar in the image from the camera
> To what we mean by Avatar, please read this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10026823)
- [ ] Decide a mapping for the remote to control X, Y, ROLL, PITCH and yaw of the AVATAR 
- [ ] Control avatar velocity in the desired parameters from the Remote
- [ ] Find a way to have both a delayed shutdown and hardware shutdown for it to be as fast as possible


## Extra for docker
1. Learn how to use docker compose for multiple nodes in ros2, a simple publisher and subscriber can be used
2. Find how we can use two devices in an ROS2 Node communicating my computer and the robot is good enough
