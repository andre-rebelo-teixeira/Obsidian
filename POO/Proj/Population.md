The Population is a set of multiple individual, where the number of individuals to be create is defined in the [Simulation Info](Simulation%20Info.md) object.

An individual will be a random distribution of [Patrol](Patrol.md) to [Planetary System](Plannetary System.md), this means that each individual will be slightly different from the other. This means for all the different individuals we will have a different max time that can be taken to patrol all the empire, we will then have random events based on the patrol comfort level, that will be ration between the time theoretical best time a individual can take to patrol the universe, and the the time it take to patrol the universe.
